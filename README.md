This repository contains a collection of diverse NLP apps encompassing three types of transformer architectures: **Autoencoding Models (Encoder-only LLM)**, **Autoregressive Models (Decoder-only LLM)**, and **SeqToSeq Models (Encoder-Decoder LLM)**. These apps use open-source models that you can run locally on your computer.
