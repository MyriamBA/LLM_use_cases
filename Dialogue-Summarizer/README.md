# Dialogue-Summarizer

## Project Overview
This project leverages the power of **Flan-T5**, a Transformer-based model from Google, to build an efficient Dialogue Summarizer. Utilizing the **Hugging Face API**, the summarizer processes conversations and generates concise, meaningful summaries, making it ideal for distilling key points from dialogues quickly and accurately. Whether youâ€™re analyzing customer support chats, summarizing meeting transcripts, or exploring conversational AI, this tool simplifies the process by automating summary generation with state-of-the-art NLP techniques.ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Ž

## Technology Stack

### **Model:**
- Utilizes [Flan-T5-Large](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large) (783M parameters), a powerful variant of the Flan-T5 family, to deliver high-quality abstractive summarization. For more details on Flan-T5 variants, check out the [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5).
### **Framework:**
- Built with Hugging Faceâ€™s [transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) for seamless model integration and inference. 
### **Dataset**:
- [DialogSum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/knkarthick/dialogsum), which is a large-scale dialogue summarization dataset (English dialogues).
### **Training**: 
- Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) with **LoRA** configuration to adapt the model efficiently, tuning **0.6%** of parameters to save resources, speed up training, and avoid overfitting.
### **WandB Integration:**
- Integrated with Weights & Biases (WandB) from the projectâ€™s outset to track and visualize the training process. All training metrics, evaluation results, and performance logs are reported to WandB, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis of the modelâ€™s progress. Explore the [dashboard](https://wandb.ai/site/) for detailed insights into experiments and hyperparameter tuning.

### ** Streamlit for UI**:
- The frontend is built using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for your dialogue and generating the summary.
